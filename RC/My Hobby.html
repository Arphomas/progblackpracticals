	<h2>The Weapons</h2>
	<p>Across the 20 years of this games history, there have been many different weapons. Within the current main games, there are a total of 14, with a 15th having appeared only within "Monster Hunter Tri". There are a further 3 weapons from spinoff titles. The mobile game "Monster Hunter Explore" added 1 new unique weapon, the Accel Axe, while the MMO game "Monster Hunter Frontier" added the Magnet Spike and the Tonfas. While these weapons have existed in older games, and the players have voiced continuously the want for the weapons over the years since their absence in newer main games, the development team is yet to begin adding any new weapons, which last happened within Monster Hunter 4. However, the team consantly refines and expands upon the current 14 weapons, and the sheer amount of effort for these weapons is often enough to satisfy the fans, and justify not needing even more effort to bring one of the older forgotten weapons up to par with the modern selection.</p>
<p>The first game boasted only 7 weapons. The Greatsword, Sword and Shield, Dual Blades, Hammer and Lance as the title's melee weapons, and both the Heavy and Light Bowguns as the ranged options.
<p>The second game introduced the Longsword, Hunting Horn, Gunlance, as well as the Bow.
<p>The third generation originally had less weapons, as the older games were developed on Sony's Playstation consoles, but Tri was the first game for the Nintendo Wii. As such, the Dual Blades, Gunlance, Hunting Horn and Bow did not return until the expansion, Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate. However, the Bowguns were expanded for this title, being a modular system that allowed for Light, Heavy or even Medium Bowguns depending on the weight of the used parts. A new weapon was also introduced in this game, and unlike the Medium Bowgun, the Switch Axe has been present as part of the main roster of weapons ever since, as a trick weapon that can morph between an axe and a sword mode, allowing for high mobility, or short range but high damage.
<p>Within the 4th generation, two weapons were added, those being the Insect Glaive, which allowed for the use of a bug companion to deal damage and gather buffs, and the Charge blade, the counter part to the Switch Axe which speciallized in guarding in a sword mode, and large AoE combos in an axe mode.
<p>In the 5th generation, and what currently is known of the 6th, no new weapons have yet been added.
	<h2>The Monsters</h2>
	<p> Within a game franchise called "Monster Hunter", it is inevitable that the players will need a range of creatures to hunt, and the development team at Capcom is always ready to deliver. Beginning from a whopping 17 in the first installment, the franchise has grown significatnly to ~250 monsters as of the 4th trailer of the 6th main game, Monster Hunter Wilds. With every game and its expansion often hosting 20-30 of both new and returning monsters, there is never a shortage of new and unique fights within any given game, even if a game might not have every monster, unlike a series such as Pokemon (until the recent games that is).
